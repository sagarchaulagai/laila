 Write a MATLAB program that plots the impulse response of the three-point smoothing
filter. Plot also the frequency response of this system.
clc; clear; close all;
% Impulse response of 3-point smoothing filter
h = (1/3)*ones(1,3);
n = 0:2;
subplot(2,1,1);
stem(n, h, 'filled');
grid on;
xlabel('n');
ylabel('h[n]');
title('Impulse Response of 3-Point Smoothing Filter');
% Frequency response
[H, w] = freqz(h, 1, 512);
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(w/pi, abs(H));
grid on;
xlabel('Normalized Frequency (\times\pi rad/sample)');
ylabel('|H(e^{j\omega})|');
title('Magnitude Response of 3-Point Smoothing Filter');
